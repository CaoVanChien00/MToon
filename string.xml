    //Connection_problem_question_answer
    <string name="question_connection_1">Why does ShareX need both a Wi-Fi hotspot &amp; Bluetooth?</string>
    <string name="answer_connection_1">1. ShareX uses a Wi-Fi hotspot and Bluetooth to send and receive files. After a transfer is complete, the Wi-Fi hotspot is turned off automatically. Make sure your device supports the "Portable hotspot" functionality before you start transferring files. \n2. Keeping Bluetooth on doesn’t affect battery usage.\nShareX needs Bluetooth to find nearby devices faster.</string>
    <string name="question_connection_2">What do I do if I can’t find the sender/receiver or can’t connect?</string>
    <string name="answer_connection_2">Here are a few things to check:\n1. Make sure both devices allow ShareX to access their location.\n2. Make sure both devices support ‘Portable hotspot’ functionality.\n3. Make sure that Wi-Fi hotspots on both devices have been turned on successfully. If not, see ‘My Wi-Fi hotspot won’t turn on. What should I do?’\nAfter this, relaunch ShareX and try to connect again.\nHere’s what else you can try if you still can’t connect:\n1. Bring the two devices closed to each other. Maybe they are too far apart.\n2. Move to a different physical location.\n3. Try switching roles with your counterpart and send a file instead of receiving, and see if you can connect then.</string>
    <string name="question_connection_3">My Wi-Fi hotspot won’t turn on. What should I do?</string>
    <string name="answer_connection_3">1. Make sure both devices support ‘Portable hotspot’ functionality. You can find this item in the Settings.\n2. Compatibility issues with some devices exist which make the process of turning the Wi-Fi hotspot on longer. Try relaunching ShareX.\n3. Try switching roles with your counterpart and send a file instead of receiving, and see if you can connect then.</string>
    <string name="question_connection_4">I’m a sender and I can’t connect to the receiver’s device after tapping the profile photo. What should I do?</string>
    <string name="answer_connection_4">This usually happens because of unstable networks or compatibility issues. Try these:\n1. Exit ShareX on both devices, launch again, then try to connect.\n2. If this doesn’t help, contact us at himintech.marketing@gmail.com and describe your issue.</string>
    <string name="question_connection_5">Why does ShareX turn on Bluetooth automatically during transfers?</string>
    <string name="answer_connection_5">ShareX needs Bluetooth to find nearby devices faster. ShareX turns off Bluetooth automatically after a transfer is complete.</string>

    //menu_transfer_problem_question_answer
    <string name="question_transfer_1">Why is the transfer speed too low?</string>
    <string name="answer_transfer_1">1. Make sure the two devices are close to each other.\n2. The two devices are closer, the faster the speed gets.\n3. Keep the network environment clean. Having many devices emitting Wi-Fi signals nearby can interfere with the transfer.\n4. Clear up the device’s system. Having many apps connecting to Wi-Fi at the same time may also result in slow file transfer.</string>
    <string name="question_transfer_2">Cannot save received files?</string>
    <string name="answer_transfer_2">Please reboot your phone and try again.</string>
    <string name="question_transfer_3">Cannot find files you want to transfer?</string>
    <string name="answer_transfer_3">Photos just saved may not be found immediately in ShareX. Please wait for a while or reboot your phone, then try again.</string>
    <string name="question_transfer_4">Did the transfer interrupt or fail?</string>
    <string name="answer_transfer_4">The distance will affect the transmission, we recommend you put both devices closer to prevent transfer interruption. Wi-Fi or hotspot is not stable, please reboot your phone and try again.</string>
    <string name="question_transfer_5">How to transfer files between android devices and IOS devices?</string>
    <string name="answer_transfer_5">1. For android, click “Send” on ShareX and then wait until the QR code appears. \n 2. For IOS, click Scan on ShareX, and then scan the QR on the Android device.</string>

    //menu_storage_problem_question_answer
    <string name="question_storage_1">Where are the files I receive stored?</string>
    <string name="answer_storage_1">ShareX saves received files to the ShareX folder by default. If you still can’t find the files you received, see the next answer.</string>
    <string name="question_storage_2">I can’t find the files I received. What should I do?</string>
    <string name="answer_storage_2">You can view all received files after you tap “ShareX” on ShareX’s start page. You can also view received files in the corresponding system app.\nCan’t find the files you just received may appear in ShareX with a delay. Wait a minute or two, reboot your phone, and take another look.</string>
